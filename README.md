The robot can execute shell commands.
Do not run outside of a virtual machine unless you like to take risks.

Finished

* Few basic services (don't want LLM figuring out how to do what they want to do want to provide them a way to do it)
* Workers which can eventually be controlled by a coordinator
* Postgres vector database for running a database locally
* Call gpt-3/4
* Wrote me a few research articles and once tried to brute force sudo access

To do

* Coordinator
* Prompt Evaluation
* More thinking about shell access
* More analysis of prompt length tradeoffs prompt language tradeoffs
* Implement better context
